A collection of icons specially made for [Plimsoll](https://github.com/severnbronies/Plimsoll) based on a rather unusual 26 pixel grid. 

Rough design rules
------------------

* No faux 3D. Make icons flat and two dimensional.
* Outlined style. No heavy fills.
* Use a 26Ã—26 grid for layout. Vertically and horizontally centre any icons that don't cleanly fill the grid.
* Use a consistent stroke width of 2px.
* Use a border radius of 3px where necessary.
* Leave a space of at least 2px between parallel lines, so they don't get lost when shrunk down.
